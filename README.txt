Supervised Learning Assignment 

To run the code:

Go to the following Github link, and clone the repository.

https://github.com/bjaladanki3/ML7641-Assignment2.git

All the necessary code is within the labeled python files. 
The data is in the adult.hdf files.
The folders labeled “CONTPEAKS,” “FLIPFLOP,” “NN,” and “TSP” contain all the output generated from the code.
The folders appended with “OUTPUT” contains the same output, along with corresponding graphs/tables made from that data. 



To run the code, install JDK and Jython

To run the code for part 1 to find better weights:
 - Backpropogation: jython NN0.py
 - Randomized Hill Climbing: jython NN1.py
 - Simulated Annealing: jython NN2.py
 - Genetic Algorithms: jython NN3.py

To run the code for part 2 optimization problems:
